# TraineeshipProject
In this project we will learn how to build a monitoring station for counting the people who enter and exit a specific place. We will couple this by learning environmental information for this place, for example information such as temperature, humidity, light and air pressure. We will use an Arduino based platform with a lot of sensors for this task. We will collect the data and the data will be published on a web platform! The process is automated, the students do not need to know about programming the web. We will analyze and visualize the data, gathered from the station, using various tools and methods and try to answer questions like: in humid days more people take the elevator or the stairs? The correlation will be simple and very simple statistics are required (like max, mean,median, etc.) Programming of the Arduino platform will be in C.
